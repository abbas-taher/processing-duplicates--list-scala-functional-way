## Tutorial 101: Processing consecutive duplicates in a list of data using Scala - a functional approach   
### Exercise examples: A step by step guide to solving a few of the famous Nine-Nine problmes

This Scala tutorial presents a generalized solution for solving problems 8-11 of the famous Ninety-Nine Prolog problems (by Werner Hett). 
Given a list of integers that contain consecutive duplicates I present here a step by step guide for approaching these types of problems and eventually produce a generalized algorithm that can process duplicates in a generalized approach 

base on solving these puzzles (and comparing your solutions with solutions of others) is a good way to “get a feel” for programing language and to explore idiomatic approaches to particular kind of problems.In this post, I would like to share a few code snippets that can help understand Spark 2.0 API.

For illustration purposes, I am using 6 data pairs that represent sales data each with an id and a value as follows:
