## Tutorial 101: Processing consecutive duplicates in a list using Scala - a functional approach   
### Step by step examples to solving problems 8-11 from the famous Nine-Nine problmes

This tutorial presents a generalized solution for solving problems 8-11 of the famous Ninety-Nine Prolog problems (by Werner Hett). Given a list of integers, the tutorial explains how to process consecutive duplicates using Scala. The approach is functional and provides a description of the more generalized algorithm to solve these 4 problems.

For illustration purposes, I am using 6 data pairs that represent sales data each with an id and a value as follows:

Here I presented a few code snippets that you can use to learn Scala. Using recursion, lists, and parametrized types you can get a good feeling for the Scala programing language and take your first to explore idiomatic approaches to these particular kind of problems using this powerful and expressive programming language.
